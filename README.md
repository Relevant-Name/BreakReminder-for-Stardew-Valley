# BreakReminder-for-Stardew-Valley

Really it just tells you how many days you've played and how long you've been playing for in hours/minutes/seconds every time you start a new day,
hopefully you can use this information as a reminder to take a break!

I made it for myself and it works for me, feel free to use it or change things if you want
